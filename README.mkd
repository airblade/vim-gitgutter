## Vim Git Gutter

A Vim plugin which shows a git diff in the 'gutter' (sign column).  It shows whether each line has been added, modified, and where lines have been removed.

This is a port of the [Git Gutter][st2gg] plugin for Sublime Text 2.


### Screenshot

![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter/master/screenshot.png)

In the screenshot above you can see:

* Line 15 has been modified.
* Lines 21-24 are new.
* A line or lines were removed between lines 25 and 26.


### Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing [pathogen.vim][pathogen], and then simply copy and paste:

```
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone git://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter.git
```

Or for [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) users:

Add `Bundle 'airblade/vim-gitgutter'` to your `~/.vimrc` and then:

* either within Vim: `:BundleInstall`
* or in your shell: `vim +BundleInstall +qall`


### Usage

You don't have to do anything: it just works.

If you want vim-gitgutter off by default, add `let g:gitgutter_enabled = 0` to your `~/.vimrc`.

You can explicitly turn vim-gitgutter off and on:

* turn off with `:GitGutterDisable`
* turn on with `:GitGutterEnable`
* toggle with `:GitGutterToggle`.

And you can turn line highlighting on and off (defaults to off):

* turn on with `:GitGutterLineHighlightsEnable`
* turn off with `:GitGutterLineHighlightsDisable`
* toggle with `:GitGutterLineHighlightsToggle`.

Furthermore you can jump between hunks:

* jump to next hunk: `:GitGutterNextHunk`
* jump to previous hunk: `:GitGutterPrevHunk`.

You may want to add mappings for these if you use them often.

If you want to define your own highlights, you can turn off vim-gitgutter's with `let g:gitgutter_highlights = 0` in your `~/.vimrc`.


### FAQ

> The colours in the sign column are weird.

The syntax highlighting for your sign column is probably set strangely.  Either modify your colorscheme or add this to your `~/.vimrc`:

```
highlight clear SignColumn
```

> What happens if I also use another plugin which uses signs (e.g. Syntastic)?

Vim only allows one sign per line.  Before adding a sign to a line, vim-gitgutter checks whether a sign has already been added by somebody else.  If so it doesn't do anything.  In other words vim-gitgutter won't overwrite another plugin's signs.  It also won't remove another plugin's signs.


### Alternatives

Vim alternatives:

* [git-gutter-vim][ggv]
* [vim-git-inline-diff][vgid]
* [quickfixsigns_vim][qf] (a superset of this functionality)
* [iwilldiffer][iwd]
* [svndiff][svndiff]
* [sign-diff][signdiff]
* [changesPlugin][changes]

Other editors:

* [Git Gutter][st2gg] for Sublime Text 2
* [git-gutter.el][gge] for Emacs

Also, this may be of interest:

* [fugitive.vim][fugitive] is a full-on Git wrapper.  It doesn't show git diffs in the gutter (ha!) but it does a bazillion other git things.
