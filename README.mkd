## Vim Git Gutter

A Vim plugin which shows a git diff in the 'gutter' (sign column).  It shows whether each line has been added, modified, and where lines have been removed.

This is a port of the [Git Gutter][st2gg] plugin for Sublime Text 2.


### Screenshot

![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter/master/screenshot.png)

In the screenshot above you can see:

* Line 15 has been modified.
* Lines 21-24 are new.
* A line or lines were removed between lines 25 and 26.


### Installation

Before installation, please check your Vim supports signs by running `:echo has('signs')`.  `1` means you're all set; `0` means you need to install a Vim with signs support.  If you're compiling Vim yourself you need the 'big' or 'huge' feature set.  [MacVim][] supports signs.

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing [pathogen.vim][pathogen], and then simply copy and paste:

```
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone git://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter.git
```

Or for [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) users:

Add `Bundle 'airblade/vim-gitgutter'` to your `~/.vimrc` and then:

* either within Vim: `:BundleInstall`
* or in your shell: `vim +BundleInstall +qall`


### Usage

You don't have to do anything: it just works.

You can explicitly turn vim-gitgutter off and on (defaults to on):

* turn off with `:GitGutterDisable`
* turn on with `:GitGutterEnable`
* toggle with `:GitGutterToggle`.

And you can turn line highlighting on and off (defaults to off):

* turn on with `:GitGutterLineHighlightsEnable`
* turn off with `:GitGutterLineHighlightsDisable`
* toggle with `:GitGutterLineHighlightsToggle`.

Furthermore you can jump between `[count]` hunks:

* jump to next hunk: `:[count]GitGutterNextHunk [count]`
* jump to previous hunk: `:[count]GitGutterPrevHunk [count]`.

You may want to add mappings for these if you use them often.  For example:

```viml
nmap <silent> ]h :<C-U>execute v:count1 . "GitGutterNextHunk"<CR>
nmap <silent> [h :<C-U>execute v:count1 . "GitGutterPrevHunk"<CR>
```

Finally, you can force vim-gitgutter to update its signs across all buffers with `:GitGutterAll`.

See the customisation section below for how to change the defaults.


### Customisation

You can customise:

* The sign column's colours
* Whether or not the sign column is shown when there aren't any signs (defaults to no)
* The signs' colours and symbols
* Line highlights
* Extra arguments for `git diff`
* Whether or not vim-gitgutter is on initially (defaults to on)
* Whether or not signs are shown (defaults to yes)
* Whether or not line highlighting is on initially (defaults to off)
* Whether or not vim-gitgutter runs on `BufEnter` (defaults to yes)
* Whether or not vim-gitgutter runs for all buffers on `FocusGained` (defaults to yes)

Please note that vim-gitgutter won't override any colours or highlights you've set in your colorscheme.


#### Sign column

The background colour of the sign column is controlled by the `SignColumn` highlight group.  This will be either set in your colorscheme or Vim's default.

To find out where it's set, and to what it's set, use `:verbose highlight SignColumn`.

If your `SignColumn` is not set (`:highlight SignColumn` gives you `SignColumn xxx cleared`), vim-gitgutter will set it to the same as your line number column (i.e. the `LineNr` highlight group).

To change your sign column's appearance, update your colorscheme or `~/.vimrc` like this:

* For the same appearance as your line number column: `highlight clear SignColumn`
* For a specific appearance on terminal Vim: `highlight SignColumn ctermbg=whatever`
* For a specific appearance on gVim/MacVim: `highlight SignColumn guibg=whatever`

By default the sign column will appear when there are signs to show and disappear when there aren't.  If you would always like the sign column to be there, add `let g:gitgutter_sign_column_always = 1` to your `~/.vimrc`.


#### Signs' colours and symbols

To customise the colours, set up the following highlight groups in your colorscheme or `~/.vimrc`:

```viml
GitGutterAdd          " an added line
GitGutterChange       " a changed line
GitGutterDelete       " at least one removed line
GitGutterChangeDelete " a changed line followed by at least one removed line
```

You can either set these with `highlight GitGutterAdd {key}={arg}...` or link them to existing highlight groups with, say, `highlight link GitGutterAdd DiffAdd`.

To customise the symbols, add the following to your `~/.vimrc`:

```viml
let g:gitgutter_sign_added = 'xx'
let g:gitgutter_sign_modified = 'yy'
let g:gitgutter_sign_removed = 'zz'
let g:gitgutter_sign_modified_removed = 'ww'
```

#### Whether or not signs are shown

If you never want signs to be shown (presumably you only want the line highlights), add this to your `~/.vimrc`:

```viml
let g:gitgutter_signs = 0
```

#### Line highlights

Similarly to the signs' colours, set up the following highlight groups in your colorscheme or `~/.vimrc`:

```viml
GitGutterAddLine          " default: links to DiffAdd
GitGutterChangeLine       " default: links to DiffChange
GitGutterDeleteLine       " default: links to DiffDelete
GitGutterChangeDeleteLine " default: links to GitGutterChangeLineDefault, i.e. DiffChange
```

#### Extra arguments for `git diff`

If you want to pass extra arguments to `git diff`, for example to ignore whitespace, do so like this:

```viml
let g:gitgutter_diff_args = '-w'
```

#### To turn off vim-gitgutter by default

Add `let g:gitgutter_enabled = 0` to your `~/.vimrc`.


#### To turn on line highlighting by default

Add `let g:gitgutter_highlight_lines = 1` to your `~/.vimrc`.


#### To stop vim-gitgutter running on `BufEnter`

This is on by default but causes a noticeable lag for some people.  To turn it off, add this to your `~/.vimrc`:

```
let g:gitgutter_on_bufenter = 0
```

If you turn it off, vim-gitgutter will instead run every time you read or write a buffer.


#### To stop vim-gitgutter running for all buffers on `FocusGained`

This is on by default but causes a noticeable lag for some people.  To turn it off, add this to your `~/.vimrc`:

```viml
let g:gitgutter_all_on_focusgained = 0
```

Note that this is always off with gVim on Windows due to a Vim/shell bug causing an infinite loop.


### FAQ

> Why are the colours in the sign column weird?

Your colorscheme is configuring the `SignColumn` highlight group weirdly.  Please see the section above on customising the sign column.

> Why does the window flicker when the signs are redrawn?

This happens on certain combinations of OS and Vim.  You can prevent the flicker by adding `let g:gitgutter_sign_column_always = 1` to your `~/.vimrc`.

> There's a noticeable lag when vim-gitter runs; how can I avoid it?

By default vim-gitgutter runs often so the signs are as accurate as possible.  However on some systems this causes a noticeable lag.  If you would like to trade a little accuracy for speed, add one or both of these to your `~/.vimrc`:

```viml
let g:gitgutter_on_bufenter = 0
let g:gitgutter_all_on_focusgained = 0
```

> Why is no sign shown if I delete the first line(s) in a file?

vim-gitgutter shows removed lines with a sign on the line above.  In this case there isn't a line above so vim-gitgutter can't show the sign.

> What happens if I also use another plugin which uses signs (e.g. Syntastic)?

Vim only allows one sign per line.  Before adding a sign to a line, vim-gitgutter checks whether a sign has already been added by somebody else.  If so it doesn't do anything.  In other words vim-gitgutter won't overwrite another plugin's signs.  It also won't remove another plugin's signs.

> Why aren't any signs showing at all?

Here are some things you can check:

* Your git config is compatible with the version of git which your Vim is calling (`:echo system('git --version')`).
* Your Vim supports signs (`:echo has('signs')` should give `1`).
* Your file is being tracked by git and has unstaged changes.
* `grep` is on your path and available to Vim (`:echo executable('grep')` should return 1)
